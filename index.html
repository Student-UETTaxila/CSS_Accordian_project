                <p>>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of elements and tags that tell a web browser how to display text, images, and other multimedia content. While it's essential for web development, it's not a programming language, but rather a way to structure and organize information for the web.</p>

                <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and visual layout of a document written in a markup language like HTML. Essentially, it dictates how elements on a webpage should be displayed, including things like colors, fonts, spacing, and even animations. Think of HTML as the structure of a house (the walls, floors, etc.), and CSS as the interior design (paint colors, furniture placement, etc.).

                    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development with JavaScript.
